### Features 
## Backend API 
CRUD operations: 
  - GET /todos: Retrieves all todo items
  - POST /todos: Add a new todo object
  - DELETE /todos/<id>: Deletes specific todo item with corresponding id

## Database 
Stores todos with fields: id, name, and due_date 

## Frontend: 
  - Simple HTML/CSS interface for users to add, delete and view their todos
  - Interacts with backend API using JavaScript


## Note 
This was my first "full-stack" application, and I'm happy with how it turned out. It features a super simple interface, as the main goal of this project was to learn how to connect the front end to the back end using APIs. Through this project, I definitely learned a lot and will keep building more and more advanced full-stack web applications. In the future, I would like to implement a frontend framework like React or Vue, but that will come later after I get a better hang of things.
